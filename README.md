# Pymaceuticals-Starter

249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Analysis

Bar Plot:

The Bar plot indicates that the drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane had the most observations, with over 200 timepoints each, while the regimens Propriva and Stelasyn had the least number of timepoints, with fewer than 200 observations each.

Pie Plot:

The pie plot indicates that there were slightly more male mice than female mice in the study, with males comprising 51% of the total population and females comprising 49%.

Calculated Quartiles and Outliers:

The data show that the tumor volumes for the different drug regimens had a wide range of values, with some drugs having larger interquartile ranges (IQRs) than others. The box plots also highlight the presence of outlier, which are values that fall outside of the typical range of the data.

Line Plot:

The line plot shows the tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse treated with Capomulin. This visualization provides a detailed view of how the tumor volume changed over time for this particular mouse. The plot indicates that the tumor volume decreased over time for this mouse, suggesting that the Capomulin regimen was effective in suppressing tumor growth.

Correlation Coefficient and Linear Regression Model:

The correlation coefficient and linear regression model show that there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
